# The Monty Hall Problem

It's true that the Monty Hall Problem has experienced more than enough coverage. Nonetheless, I would like to share an analogy that helped me understand the problem better, and will hopefully be useful for you as well.

## The Problem

The Monty Hall problem was named after the host of the gameshow Let's Make a Deal that that originated in the 1970s. The premise of this show is that a candidate has three candidate doors they could choose from. Behind two of them, there were goats hidden, whereas the grand prize of $1,000,000 was behind a third one. The odds of guessing the door with the grand prize therefore is 1:3 for each door respectively. When the candidate chooses one of the doors, the host reveals a door behind which a goat would be hiding. Based on this new information, the candidate has the choice to either change doors or stick to their initial choice. Most people in the show would stick with their initial choice, although the chances would be higher if they were to switch doors. Counterintuitively to many, the chance would not only rise to 1:2, but to 2:3 if the candidate changed doors.

## The Analogy

The reason behind this becomes obvious if the rules of the game are slightly changed. Imagine for a moment that instead of three doors, there were 10 doors. After the initial choice, 8 of the doors with goats are revealed - yes, the game would be obnoxious, but stick with me. Regardless of which other door the candidate initially opened, 8 doors with goats would be opened also. The initial chance of guessing the right door was 1:10, and this 1:10 chance remains once the other doors are revealed. The remaining door takes the remaining chance of 9:10.

You may extend this analogy to something yet bigger. If you had to blindly guess which city I was born in, and after your choice, I had to exclude all cities I wasn't born in, leaving you with one more option, chances would be huge that the other city left is the one I was born in.
